Title: Evaluation of Methods for Dealing with Missing Data in Machine Learning Algorithms
Version: 0.4.0
Author: Jan Borowski, Piotr Fic
Maintainer: Jan Borowski <janborowka7@gmail.com>
Description: Package crate uniform interface for several advanced imputations missing data methods. Every available method can be used as a part of mlr3 pipelines whats allow easy tuning and performance evaluation. Most of the used function work separately on train and test sets ( imputation is trained on the training set and impute train data, after that imputation is again trained on test set and impute test data). This approach makes training imputation parameters unprofitable.
